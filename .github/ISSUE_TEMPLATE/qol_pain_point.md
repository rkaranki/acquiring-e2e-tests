## Pain point

_Describe the issue your facing that makes you think there should be a better way to get the job done. Try to include examples as much as possible so it's easier for others to relate to._

## How to reproduce

_Briefly state the step required to reproduce the issue or pointers to where it can be observed (like commit hashes, version, etc.)_

## Scope

_Where is this pain being noticed?_

| Pain  | In                  |
| :---: | ------------------- |
|  :x:  | Documentation       |

|       | Metrics             |
|       | Reporting           |
|       | Root cause analysis |

## Expected outcome

_Which benefits will the removal of this pain point bring to the team?_

## Improvement suggestion(s)

_How to remove the pain. Doesn't need to get technical as those details will transpire in the implementation. Not mandatory when creating the issue, but inputs on a way to address the pain are very much welcome._

## Implications

_Which elements of the development environment are affected by the change to overcome this pain? Be as specific as possible without being verbose. The idea is to engage the reader into consider whether the proposed improvement is actually valuable as well as to reduce the chance of overlooking side-effects._
